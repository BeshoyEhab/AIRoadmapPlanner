## üéØ Core Functionality

### AI Roadmap Generation

The heart of TimePlan lies in its sophisticated AI integration that transforms simple learning objectives into comprehensive study plans. The system utilizes Google's Gemini AI models to analyze user input and generate structured learning paths that include:

**Phase-Based Learning Structure**: Each roadmap is organized into logical phases that build upon previous knowledge. The AI considers the complexity of the subject matter, typical learning progression patterns, and industry best practices to create a coherent learning journey.

**Resource Curation**: For each phase, the AI suggests relevant learning resources including online courses, tutorials, documentation, books, and practical projects. These resources are carefully selected based on quality, relevance, and alignment with the learning objectives.

**Time Estimation**: The system provides realistic time estimates for each phase and mini-goal, taking into account the complexity of the material and typical learning speeds. These estimates help learners plan their schedule effectively while maintaining flexibility.

**Skill Progression Mapping**: The AI identifies key skills that will be developed throughout the learning journey and maps them to specific phases, helping learners understand how their capabilities will evolve over time.

### Progress Tracking System

TimePlan's progress tracking system is designed to provide comprehensive insights into your learning journey while maintaining motivation and accountability:

**Mini-Goal Architecture**: Each phase is broken down into specific, actionable mini-goals that can be completed in focused study sessions. This granular approach makes large learning objectives feel manageable and provides frequent opportunities for achievement and progress validation.

**Flexible Time Management**: The system accommodates different learning styles and schedules by allowing users to adjust time allocations and deadlines. Whether you prefer intensive study sessions or gradual, consistent progress, TimePlan adapts to your preferred learning rhythm.

**Visual Progress Indicators**: Real-time progress visualization helps learners understand their advancement through both individual phases and the overall roadmap. Progress bars, completion percentages, and milestone markers provide immediate feedback on achievements.

**Completion Tracking**: The system maintains detailed records of completed mini-goals, including completion dates and time spent, enabling learners to analyze their productivity patterns and optimize their study habits.

## üîê Security & Privacy

### API Key Security Best Practices

#### ‚úÖ What TimePlan Does Right

**Client-Side Storage**: API keys are stored only in your browser's localStorage, never on external servers.

**Direct API Communication**: Your browser communicates directly with Google AI services, bypassing our servers entirely.

**No Server-Side Key Storage**: TimePlan backend never sees or stores your API keys.

**User Control**: You have complete control over your API key - add, remove, or update it anytime.

**Local Validation**: API key format validation happens locally before any external requests.

#### ‚ùå Security Anti-Patterns We Avoid

- **No Environment Variables**: Never store client-side API keys in environment variables
- **No Repository Commits**: API keys are never committed to version control
- **No Server Proxying**: We don't proxy API requests through our servers
- **No Shared Keys**: Each user manages their own individual API key
- **No Third-Party Analytics**: No tracking or data collection of API usage

### Content Security Policy (CSP)

For enhanced security in production, configure these CSP headers:

```http
Content-Security-Policy: 
  default-src 'self'; 
  script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval';
  style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline';
  connect-src 'self' https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com;
  img-src 'self' data: blob:;
  font-src 'self' data:;
  object-src 'none';
  base-uri 'self';
  form-action 'self';
```

### Privacy Guarantees

**üîí Zero Data Collection**: TimePlan collects no personal information, usage statistics, or behavioral data.

**üîí Local-First Architecture**: All your data remains on your device unless you explicitly export it.

**üîí No Cookies**: The application doesn't use cookies or tracking technologies.

**üîí No User Accounts**: No sign-up required means no personal information collected.

**üîí Encrypted Communication**: All external API calls use HTTPS encryption.

### API Key Management Tips

1. **Keep Keys Private**: Never share your API key or commit it to public repositories
2. **Regular Rotation**: Consider rotating your API key periodically for security
3. **Monitor Usage**: Check your Google AI Studio dashboard for unusual usage patterns
4. **Backup Safely**: If backing up, ensure API keys are stored securely
5. **Use Restrictions**: Configure API key restrictions in Google Cloud Console if needed

### Incident Response

If you suspect your API key has been compromised:

1. **Immediately Revoke**: Delete the compromised key from Google AI Studio
2. **Generate New Key**: Create a new API key with fresh credentials
3. **Update Application**: Replace the key in TimePlan settings
4. **Monitor Billing**: Check Google Cloud billing for unexpected usage
5. **Review Activity**: Look for suspicious activity in your Google account

## üîí Privacy and Security

TimePlan prioritizes user privacy and data security through several key measures:

**Local Data Storage**: All personal data, including study plans, progress information, and settings, is stored locally in your browser. This approach ensures that your learning data never leaves your device unless you explicitly choose to export it.

**API Key Security**: Your Google Gemini API key is stored securely in your browser's local storage and is only used for direct communication with Google's AI services. The key is never transmitted to or stored on any third-party servers.

**No User Tracking**: TimePlan does not implement any user tracking, analytics, or data collection mechanisms. Your usage patterns and learning progress remain completely private.

**Secure Communication**: All communication with external services (Google AI) uses encrypted HTTPS connections to protect data in transit.
